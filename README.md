# ValoBot

Proof of concept for the usage of Riot/Valorant API created in a few days<br>
This is also a test project for me to use for the first time TypeScript & Supabase

There are a lot of unused functions to create Discord commands but I was to lazy to create them<br>
Cache and TS defenitions usage must be improved<br>
`/shop` & `/bundle` commands
