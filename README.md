# ValoBot

Proof of concept Discord Bot for the usage of Riot/Valorant API, created in a few days<br>
This is also a test project for me to use TypeScript & Supabase for the first time (so useful)

There are a lot of unused functions to create Discord commands but I was to lazy to implement them<br>
Project<br>
This project can be improved in a lot of ways, mainly TS defs and cache usage<br>
`/shop` & `/bundle` commands
